Ripple vision is for value to be exchanged as quickly as information. Although information moves around the world instantly, a single payment from one country to another is slow, expensive and unreliable. In the US, a typical international payment takes 3-5 days to settle, has an error rate of at least 5% and an average cost of 42 USD. Worldwide, there are 180 trillion USD worth of cross-border payments made every year, with a combined cost of more than USD1.7 trillion a year. This is a huge number.

With the Internet of Value, a value transaction such as a foreign currency payment, can happen instantly, just as how people have been sharing words, images and videos online for decades. And it’s not just money. The Internet of Value will enable the exchange of any asset that is of value to someone, including stocks, votes, frequent flyer points, securities, intellectual property, music, scientific discoveries, and more.

# Bonus : Compare Ripple vs Bitcoin

## Difference #1: Mining process

Bitcoins are created through mining by the users. Ripple creators have already created 100 billion Ripples for the release. Out of these 100 billion Ripples, 55 billion will be distributed to charitable organizations, users, and strategic partners.

## Difference #2: Transaction speed

The Bitcoin Blockchain is requiring mining process. That is why Bitcoin transactions are usually taking longer to authorize than those of Ripple. In fact, Ripple transactions take just 4 seconds to authorize. Thus, Ripple transaction speed is faster than Bitcoin.

## Difference #3: De/centralized exchange

In order to buy/sell Bitcoins, one has to utilize the centralized exchange, which can potentially crash. With Ripple, you can buy or sell XRP on its own secure network.

## Difference #4: Transaction fee

Bear in mind, that each Ripple transaction has a fee, which is eventually being destroyed. Thos implies that the fee is not paid to anyone. Bitcoin, on the other hand, normally does not have any transaction fees.

## Difference #5: Information tracking

Ripple is able to track information of any kind, such as account balance. On the contrary, Bitcoin network only tracks the movement of Bitcoins.
